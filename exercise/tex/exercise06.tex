%% Task 1: M3C converter at a RL-load                     %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\task{M3C converter at a RL-load}
A controlled three-pulse midpoint circuit feeds an ohmic-inductive load. The load inductance $L$ is large, such that a pure direct current $I_\mathrm{2}$ is taken from the converter. The load resistance is $R = \SI{5}{\Omega}$. The converter transformer 
is connected to the symmetrical three-phase network with $U_\mathrm{N} = \SI{\nicefrac{230}{400}}{\volt} $ (effective value of phase voltage / line-to-line voltage). The secondary side phase voltages point an effective value of 
$U_\mathrm{1i} = \SI{230}{\volt}, \forall i=a,b,c$. The thyristors and commutation can be assumed to be ideal.

\task{B6C converter at a motor load}

In a lifting drive, a permanent magnet DC motor is supplied by a B6C converter circuit. The B6C-topology is connected to the three-phase network.
With the assumption of $L\rightarrow\infty$ the motor operates with constant nominal current and constant nominal voltage when lifting as well as lowering the load.
This corresponds to a terminal voltage of $u_\mathrm{mot,up}(t)=U_\mathrm{mot}$ when lifting the load and $u_\mathrm{mot,down}(t)=-U_\mathrm{mot}$ when lowering it.
In order to generate the necessary torque, the motor absorbs the current $i_\mathrm{mot}(t)=I_\mathrm{mot}$.
