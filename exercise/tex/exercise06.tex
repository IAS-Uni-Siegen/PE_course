%% Task 1: M3C converter at a RL-load                     %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\task{M3C converter at an RL-load}
A controlled three-pulse midpoint circuit feeds an ohmic-inductive load. The load inductance $L$ is large, such that a pure direct current $I_\mathrm{2}$ is taken from the converter. The load resistance is $R = \SI{5}{\Omega}$. The converter transformer 
is connected to the symmetrical three-phase network with $U_\mathrm{N} = \SI{\nicefrac{230}{400}}{\volt} $ (effective value of phase voltage / line-to-line voltage). The secondary side phase voltages point an effective value of 
$U_\mathrm{1i} = \SI{230}{\volt}, \forall i=a,b,c$. The thyristors and commutation can be assumed to be ideal.

\task{B6C converter at a motor load}

In a lifting drive, a permanent magnet DC motor is supplied by a B6C converter circuit. The B6C-topology is connected to the three-phase network.
When lifting as well as lowering the load, the motor is operated with nominal current and nominal voltage. 
This corresponds to a terminal voltage of $\overline{u}_\mathrm{2}$ when lifting the load and $-\overline{u}_\mathrm{2}$ when lowering it.
In order to generate the necessary torque $M$, the motor absorbs the current $\overline{i}_\mathrm{2}$.
