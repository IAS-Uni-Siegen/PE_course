\task{Symmetrical 3-phase switching rectifier}

An symmetrical switching rectifier in three-phase bridge topology shall supply a
symmetrical three-phase consumer. The consumer is simulated by an inductance and 
a sinusoidal counter voltage per phase. The inverter is operated with a basic frequency clock.
The switching elements are considered as ideal.
