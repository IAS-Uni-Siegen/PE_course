\task{Symmetrical 3-phase switching rectifier}

An symmetrical switching rectifier in three-phase bridge topology shall supply a
symmetrical three-phase consumer. The consumer is simulated by an inductance and 
a sinusoidal counter voltage per phase. The inverter is operated with a basic frequency clock.
The switching elements are considered as ideal.

\subtask{Create a table with all possible switching states for basic frequency clocking.
Use the following notation: \\
$(s_\mathrm{a}(t),s_\mathrm{b}(t),s_\mathrm{c}(t))=\begin{cases}
        s_i(t)= +1 & \text{upper position,}\\
        s_i(t)= -1 & \text{lower position.}
    \end{cases}$\\
Sketch the switching states in the correct chronological order for minimum one periode.
Calculate and sketch the voltages $u_\mathrm{a,0}(t)$, $u_\mathrm{b,0}(t)$ and $u_\mathrm{c,0}(t)$ depending on these switching states.

\subtask{The internal voltages $u_\mathrm{ea}(t)$, $u_\mathrm{eb}(t)$ and $u_\mathrm{ec}(t)$ are a symmetrical voltage system, 
i.e. the following always applies: $u_\mathrm{ea}(t)+u_\mathrm{eb}(t)+u_\mathrm{ec}(t)=0V$. 
Show that this equation is also applicable for the voltages $u_\mathrm{a}(t)$, $u_\mathrm{b}(t)$ and $u_\mathrm{c}(t)$ under the same conditions.

\subtask{Decompose the voltage $u_\mathrm{a}(t)$ into a Fourier series and sketch the spectral lines related to the
amplitude of the fundamental signal up to order n=13. Hint: The following applies to the Fourier coefficients of an odd and alternating function:
