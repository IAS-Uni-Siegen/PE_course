\task{B2U topology with capactive filtering}
An uncontrolled single-phase, two-pulse rectifier circuit with capacitive filtering 
is shown in \autoref{fig:B2U_Topology_Cap_Filtering}.
All components, including the diodes, are assumed to be ideal. On the input side, 
the single-phase AC supply with voltage $u$ is connected, while on the output side, 
a smoothing capacitor $C$ and a constant current load $I_\mathrm{L}$ are present.

The angle $\alpha$ represent the time range between zero crossing of the supply voltage and the point in time
at which all four diodes are blocked, meaning the capacitor discharges through the load. The angle $\beta$ 
represents the time range between $\alpha$ and the point in time at which two of the four diodes begin to 
conduct, i.e., when the capacitor is recharged from the mains supply.
A steady-state operation is assumed for this task.

\subtask{Calculate the two angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
Note: For the calculation of $\beta$ you can use the following simple approximation: $sin(x) = x$. 
(This approximation is sufficiently accurate within a range of approximately $\SI{25}{\degree}$  around the zero point of the sine function.)}
\begin{solutionblock}
    As long as the voltage $\left| u_\mathrm{1}(t) \right|$ increase the voltage $u_\mathrm{c}(t)$ of the capacitor follows:
    \begin{equation} 
        u_\mathrm{C}(t) = \left| \hat{u_{\mathrm{1}}}\sin(\omega t)\right|.
    \end{equation}
    If the capacitor supplies the load current $I_\mathrm{0}$ the voltage $u_\mathrm{c}(t)$ at the capacitor 
    decreases linear with:
    \begin{equation} 
        \frac{d(u_\mathrm{C}(t))}{dt} = -\frac{I_\mathrm{0}}{C}.
    \end{equation} 
    If the voltage $\left| u_\mathrm{1}(t) \right|$ decreases faster than $d(u_\mathrm{C}(t))/dt$
    then all diodes blocks and the capacitor supplies the current load $I_\mathrm{0}$. This leads to:
    \begin{equation} 
        \frac{d(u_\mathrm{1}(t))}{dt} = \frac{d(\left| \hat{u_{\mathrm{1}}}\sin(\omega t)\right|)}{dt} 
        = \omega\left| \hat{u_{\mathrm{1}}}\cos(\omega t)\right| = -\frac{I_\mathrm{0}}{C}.
        \label{eq:deltaVoltageAtCapacitor_ex05}
    \end{equation} 
    Solving \eqref{eq:deltaVoltageAtCapacitor_ex05} with respect to $\omega \cdot t = \alpha$ yields
    \begin{equation}
        \alpha = \arccos(-\frac{I_\mathrm{0}}{\omega C \cdot \hat{u_{\mathrm{1}}}})
        = \arccos(-\frac{\SI{7.5}{\ampere}}{2 \pi \cdot \SI{60}{\hertz} \cdot \SI{330}{\micro\farad} \cdot \SI{156}{\volt}}) = \SI{112.8}{\degree}
    \end{equation}   
    In that moment when the voltage $\left| u_\mathrm{1}(t) \right|$ becomes equal to $u_\mathrm{C}(t)$ 
    the discharge of the capacitor stops and $u_\mathrm{C}(t)$ follows again $\left| u_\mathrm{1}(t) \right|$.
    The voltage $\left| u_\mathrm{1}(t) \right|$ increases again at $\pi$ with:
    \begin{equation}
        \left| u_\mathrm{1}sin(\omega t + \pi ) \right| = u_\mathrm{1}sin(\omega t) \quad \text{for} \quad t \leq \pi
    \end{equation}   
    The capacitor is discharging by the load  $I_\mathrm{0}$ at $\alpha$, which corresponds to a 
    voltage of: 
    \begin{equation}
        \left| u_\mathrm{1}sin(\omega t) \right| = u_\mathrm{1}sin(\alpha) 
        = \SI{156}{\volt} \cdot sin(\SI{112.8}{\degree})=\SI{143.4}{\volt}
    \end{equation}

%% Task 2: PFC rectifier %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\task{Current control with constant clock frequency}
Due to the constantly increasing load on the grid with harmonics as a result of the use of power converters, the regulations regarding the permissible harmonic content of the current consumption of electrical consumers are being tightened. It is therefore necessary, e.g. for the rectification of single-phase AC mains voltage, for example, it is necessary to design power converters with a high power factor or a largely sinusoidal input current. The system consists of a diode bridge $(D_{\mathrm{1}} \, \dots \, D_{\mathrm{4}})$, an inductor $L$, a power transistor $T_\mathrm{H}$ (usually a power MOSFET), a freewheeling diode $D_\mathrm{H}$ and an output capacitor $C_\mathrm{d}$. The prerequisite for the use of the boost converter is: $u_\mathrm{d} = U_\mathrm{d}>U_\mathrm{1}$. The boost converter is operated with a modified current control method ('Average Current Mode Control') for which the switching frequency $f_\mathrm{T}$ has a constant value $f_\mathrm{T} = \SI{20}{\kilo\hertz}$. This is realized
by comparing the current controller output variable with a triangular oscillation with switching frequency $f_\mathrm{T} = \SI{20}{\kilo\hertz}$ and suitable amplitude is compared.
Let $L = \SI{570}{\micro\henry}$ and the inductance carry a continuous current.

\subtask{Specify the voltage transformation ratio $m(t)= \frac{U_\mathrm{d}}{u'(t)}$ as a function of the duty cycle $d(t)$ is specified.}
\begin{solutionblock}
    \begin{equation}
        U_{\mathrm{L}} = d(t) u'(t) + (1-d(t))(u'(t)-U_{\mathrm{d}}).
    \end{equation}
The average voltage over the inductance for a stable operation is zero $U_{\mathrm{L}} = \SI{0}{\volt}$. 
    \begin{equation}
    0 = d(t) u'(t) + (1-d(t))(u'(t)-U_{\mathrm{d}}). 
    \end{equation}   
The ratio $m(t)= \frac{U_\mathrm{d}}{u'(t)}$ can now be determined from \eqref{eq:ex05ratio2.1}: 
  \begin{equation}
    0 = d(t)u'(t)+u'(t)-d(t)u'(t)-u'(t)+d(t)U_{\mathrm{d}},
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    0 = u'(t)-(1-d(t))U_{\mathrm{d}}.\label{eq:ex05ratio2.1}

  From equation \eqref{eq:ex05ratio2.1} it can now be concluded:

    m(t) = \frac{U_{\mathrm{d}}}{u'(t)}=\frac{1}{1-d(t)}
