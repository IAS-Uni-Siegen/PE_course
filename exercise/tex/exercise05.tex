%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\task{B2U topology with capactive filtering}
An uncontrolled single-phase, two-pulse rectifier circuit with capacitive filtering 
is shown in \autoref{fig:B2U_Topology_Cap_Filtering}.
All components, including the diodes, are assumed to be ideal. On the input side, 
the single-phase AC supply with voltage $u$ is connected, while on the output side, 
a smoothing capacitor $C$ and a constant current load $I_\mathrm{L}$ are present.

\input{fig/ex05/Fig_B2U_TopologyWithCapactiveFiltering.tex}

The angle $\alpha_\mathrm{1}$ represents the point in time at which two of the four diodes begin to conduct, 
i.e., when the capacitor is recharged from the mains supply. From the angle $\alpha_\mathrm{2}$
all four diodes are blocked, meaning the capacitor discharges through the load. 
A steady-state operation is assumed for this task.

\subtask{Calculate the two angles $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$.
Note: It is more convenient to calculate $\alpha_2$ first. For the calculation of $\alpha_1$  
you can use the following simple approximation: $sin(x) = x$. 
(This approximation is sufficiently accurate within a range of approximately $\SI{25}{\degree}$  around the zero point of the sine function.)}
\vspace{2em}\par
If you were unable to solve task (a), please use $\alpha_1=\SI{19.3}{\degree}$ and $\alpha_2=\SI{112.8}{\degree}$.

\subtask{Sketch the waveform of the capacitor voltage $u_\mathrm{C}$ for the angles $\alpha_\mathrm{1}$ and $\alpha_\mathrm{2}$ calculated in previous subtask.}

\subtask{Sketch the time-dependent waveform of the current $i_\mathrm{1}(t)$  and $i_\mathrm{2}(t)$.}

\subtask{Assume the smoothing capacitor is very large, i.e., $C\rightarrow \infty$ .What is the average active power $P_\mathrm{L}$ 
absorbed by the current source? What will $P_\mathrm{L}$ be if $C=\SI{330}{\milli\ampere}$?}


\subtask{What is the minimum blocking voltage ratings of the diodes to ensure that the rectifiers is not damaged?}

%% Task 2: PFC rectifier %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\task{PFC rectifier}
Due to the constantly increasing load on the grid with harmonics as a result of the use of power converters, the regulations regarding the permissible harmonic content of the current consumption of electrical consumers are being tightened. It is therefore necessary, e.g. for the rectification of single-phase AC mains voltage, for example, it is necessary to design power converters with a high power factor or a largely sinusoidal input current. 
A variant of a PFC rectifier circuit is shown in \autoref{fig:Boost converter with single-phase diode bridge_topology}. The system consists of a diode bridge $(D_{\mathrm{1}} \, \dots \, D_{\mathrm{4}})$, an inductor $L$, a power transistor $T$ (usually a power MOSFET), a freewheeling diode $D_\mathrm{5}$ and an output capacitor $C$. The prerequisite for the use of the boost converter is: $u_\mathrm{d} = U_\mathrm{d}>U_\mathrm{1}$. The boost converter is operated with a modified current control method ('Average Current Mode Control') for which the switching frequency $f_\mathrm{T}$ has a constant value $f_\mathrm{T} = \SI{20}{\kilo\hertz}$. This is realized by comparing the current controller output variable with a triangular oscillation with switching frequency $f_\mathrm{T} = \SI{20}{\kilo\hertz}$ and suitable amplitude is compared. Let $L = \SI{570}{\micro\henry}$ and the inductance carry a continuous current. Definition: Transmission ratio: $M = \frac{ U_\mathrm{d}}{\hat U_\mathrm{1}}$

\subtask{Specify the voltage transformation ratio $m(t)= \frac{u_{\mathrm{2}}(t)}{u'(t)}$ as a function of the duty cycle $D(t)$ is specified.}
\begin{solutionblock}
    
    \begin{equation}
        U_{\mathrm{L}} = d(t) u'(t) + (1-d(t))(u'(t)-U_{\mathrm{d}}). 
    \end{equation}
The average voltage over the inductance for a stable operation is zero $U_{\mathrm{L}} = \SI{0}{\volt}$. 
    \begin{equation}
    0 = d(t) u'(t) + (1-d(t))(u'(t)-U_{\mathrm{d}}). 
    \end{equation}   
The ratio $m(t)= \frac{U_\mathrm{d}}{u'(t)}$ can now be determined from \eqref{eq:ex05ratio2.1}: 
  \begin{equation}
    0 = d(t)u'(t)+u'(t)-d(t)u'(t)-u'(t)+d(t)U_{\mathrm{d}},
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    0 = u'(t)-(1-d(t))U_{\mathrm{d}}.\label{eq:ex05ratio2.1}
  \end{equation}
  From equation \eqref{eq:ex05ratio2.1} it can now be concluded:
  \begin{equation}
    m(t) = \frac{U_{\mathrm{d}}}{u'(t)}=\frac{1}{1-d(t)}
