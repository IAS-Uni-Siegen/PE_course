\task{Flyback converter}
A flyback converter with an input voltage range $U_\mathrm{1} = \SI{300}{\volt} \, \dots \, \SI{900}{\volt}$ is used to supply the control electronics of a frequency inverter. The converter delivers a rated output power of  $P_\mathrm{2} = \SI{30}{\watt}$ at a regulated (constant) output voltage of  $U_\mathrm{2} = \SI{15}{\volt}$. The flyback converter is operated in discontinuous current mode with a constant frequency of  $f_\mathrm{p} = \SI{500}{\kilo\hertz}$. The transformation ratio of the transformer is $N_\mathrm{1}/N_\mathrm{2}=60/12$, the inductance of the primary winding is $L_\mathrm{1} = \SI{760}{\micro\henry}$. The coupling between the primary and secondary windings is ideal. You can assume stationary operation for all calculations.
