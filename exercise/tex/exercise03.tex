\task {Inverse converter}
An inverse converter (see Fig. 1) is used to generate the negative supply voltage of a control control electronics, an inverse converter (see Fig. 1) is used. The input voltage is specified as $U_\mathrm{1}=\SI{18}{\volt}$, the output voltage is regulated to $U_\mathrm{2}=\SI{12}{\volt}$. The output power can be values in the range $P_\mathrm{2}=\SI{2}{\watt}$ to $\SI{25}{\watt}$.

\subtask{The system should operate at the limit of gap-free operation throughout the entire output power range. How should the inductance be selected so that the switching frequency is always above the hearing threshold $f_\mathrm{P}=\SI{20}{\kilo\hertz}$?}

\begin{solutionblock}
    \begin{equation}
        U_{\mathrm{1}} = u_{\mathrm{L}} = L \frac{\Delta i_{\mathrm{L}} }{\Delta t}. 
    \end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    D = \frac{U_\mathrm{2}}{U_\mathrm{1}+U_\mathrm{2}} = \frac{\SI{12}{\volt}}{\SI{18}{\volt}+\SI{12}{\volt}} = 0.4
\end{equation}
BCM is assumed
\begin{equation}
    I_\mathrm{2,min} = \frac{P_\mathrm{2}}{U_\mathrm{2}}=\frac{\SI{25}{\watt}}{\SI{12}{\volt}}=\SI{2.083}{\volt}
\end{equation}
The maximum current at BCM $\Delta i_{\mathrm{L}}$ is twice  $I_\mathrm{2,min}$.
\begin{equation}
    \Delta i_{\mathrm{L}} = 2  I_\mathrm{2,min} = \SI{4.16}{\ampere}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \Delta t = \frac{D}{f_\mathrm{P}}
\end{equation}
The inductance can therefore be determined using the following equation:
\begin{equation}
    L = \frac{\Delta t  u_{\mathrm{L}}}{\Delta i_{\mathrm{L}}}= \frac{D u_{\mathrm{L}}}{f_\mathrm{P}\Delta i_{\mathrm{L}}}= \frac{D u_{\mathrm{1}}}{f_\mathrm{P}\Delta i_{\mathrm{L}}} = \frac{0.4 \cdot \SI{18}{\volt}}{\SI{20}{\kilo\hertz}\cdot \SI{4.16}{\ampere }} = \SI{86.4}{\micro\henry}
\end{equation}

\end{solutionblock}
