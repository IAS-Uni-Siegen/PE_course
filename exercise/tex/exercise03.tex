%% Task 1: Inverse converter %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\task {Inverse converter}
An inverse converter (see Fig. 1) is used to generate the negative supply voltage of a control control electronics, an inverse converter (see Fig. 1) is used. The input voltage is specified as $U_\mathrm{1}=\SI{18}{\volt}$, the output voltage is regulated to $U_\mathrm{2}=\SI{12}{\volt}$. The output power can be values in the range $P_\mathrm{2}=\SI{2}{\watt}$ to $\SI{25}{\watt}$.

\input{./fig/ex03/Fig_inverseConverter.tex}

\subtask{The system should operate at the limit of gap-free operation throughout the entire output power range. How should the inductance be selected so that the switching frequency is always above the hearing threshold $f_\mathrm{P}=\SI{20}{\kilo\hertz}$?}

\begin{solutionblock}
    \begin{equation}
        U_{\mathrm{1}} = u_{\mathrm{L}} = L \frac{\Delta i_{\mathrm{L}} }{\Delta t}. 
    \end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    D = \frac{U_\mathrm{2}}{U_\mathrm{1}+U_\mathrm{2}} = \frac{\SI{12}{\volt}}{\SI{18}{\volt}+\SI{12}{\volt}} = 0.4
\end{equation}
BCM is assumed
\begin{equation}
    I_\mathrm{2,min} = \frac{P_\mathrm{2}}{U_\mathrm{2}}=\frac{\SI{25}{\watt}}{\SI{12}{\volt}}=\SI{2.083}{\volt}
\end{equation}
The maximum current at BCM $\Delta i_{\mathrm{L}}$ is twice  $I_\mathrm{2,min}$.
\begin{equation}
    \Delta i_{\mathrm{L}} = 2  I_\mathrm{2,min} = \SI{4.16}{\ampere}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \Delta t = \frac{D}{f_\mathrm{P}}
\end{equation}
The inductance can therefore be determined using the following equation:
\begin{equation}
    L = \frac{\Delta t  u_{\mathrm{L}}}{\Delta i_{\mathrm{L}}}= \frac{D u_{\mathrm{L}}}{f_\mathrm{P}\Delta i_{\mathrm{L}}}= \frac{D u_{\mathrm{1}}}{f_\mathrm{P}\Delta i_{\mathrm{L}}} = \frac{0.4 \cdot \SI{18}{\volt}}{\SI{20}{\kilo\hertz}\cdot \SI{4.16}{\ampere }} = \SI{86.4}{\micro\henry}
\end{equation}

\end{solutionblock}
\subtask{In what range does the switching frequency $f_\mathrm{P}$ vary?}

 \begin{solutionblock}
     The inductance equation is used again for this task:
     \begin{equation}
        L = \frac{\Delta t  u_{\mathrm{L}}}{\Delta i_{\mathrm{L}}}= \frac{D u_{\mathrm{L}}}{f_\mathrm{P}\Delta i_{\mathrm{L}}}
     \end{equation}
     This equation can be converted to $f_\mathrm{P}$ and used to determine the frequency as follows:
     \begin{equation}
        f_\mathrm{P} = \frac{Du_{\mathrm{1}}}{L\Delta i_{\mathrm{L}}} \label{equation 1.8}
     \end{equation}
     As the output power is given as a value range, the highest and lowest values can be used. The lowest and highest current should be determined from these two values, from which the value range of the frequency can then be determined.
     \begin{equation}
        I_\mathrm{1,min}= \frac{P_\mathrm{2}}{U_\mathrm{1}}=\frac{\SI{2}{\watt}}{\SI{18}{\volt}}=\SI{0.1}{\volt}
     \end{equation}
     \begin{equation}
        I_\mathrm{1,max}= \frac{P_\mathrm{2}}{U_\mathrm{1}}=\frac{\SI{25}{\watt}}{\SI{18}{\volt}}=\SI{1.38}{\volt}
     \end{equation}
     Now we can use these two terms in \ref{equation 1.8}:
     \begin{equation}
        f_\mathrm{P,min}=\frac{0.4\cdot\SI{18}{\volt}}{\SI{86.4}{\micro\henry}\cdot 2\cdot \SI{0.1}{\volt}}=\SI{416.667}{\kilo \hertz}
     \end{equation}
     \begin{equation}
        f_\mathrm{P,max}=\frac{0.4\cdot\SI{18}{\volt}}{\SI{86.4}{\micro\henry}\cdot 2\cdot \SI{1.38}{\volt}}=\SI{30.193}{\kilo \hertz}
     \end{equation}
 \end{solutionblock}

 \subtask{What is the peak value $\hat I_1$ of the transistor current?}
 \begin{solutionblock}
    As the maximum current through the transistor is the current $I_1$, these values are the same. Since the BCM is considered in this circuit, the maximum current is the peak current, which corresponds to the value of $\SI{4.16}{\ampere}$.
 \end{solutionblock}

\task {Boost-Buck converter and SEPIC topology}

The supply of a plasma coating system is realized by a boost converter and a buck converter (with common capacitance).
The converter is connected to a voltage $U_\mathrm{1}$ and provides a variable output voltage $U_\mathrm{2}$.

\input{./fig/ex03/FigTab_BoostBuckConverter}

The output voltage is set to the specified value by adjusting the duty cycles $D_\mathrm{1}$ (of transistor $T_\mathrm{1}$) 
and $D_\mathrm{2}$ (of transistor $T_\mathrm{2}$) using a control system. Both transistors operate at the same switching frequency. 
The switching frequency fluctuation of the intermediate circuit voltage and the currents in the inductors can be ignored unless otherwise stated. 
The currents in $L_\mathrm{1}$ and $L_\mathrm{2}$ show a continuous course. Both transistors are operated with the 
same relative duty cycle $D_\mathrm{1}$ = $D_\mathrm{2}$ = $D$.

\subtask{Calculate the relative duty cycle $D$ of the transistors $T_\mathrm{1}$ and $T_\mathrm{1}$ to be set to achieve an output voltage $U_\mathrm{2}$.}

\subtask{Which intermediate circuit voltage U is determined depending on $U_\mathrm{2}$?}

\subtask{Plot $D$ and the voltage against $U_\mathrm{2}$ and calculate the numerical values for $U_\mathrm{2}$ = 285V, $U_\mathrm{2}$ =
380V and $U_\mathrm{2}$ = 450V.}

\subtask{What blocking voltage strength must the transistors $T_\mathrm{1}$ and $T_\mathrm{2}$ and the diodes DBoost and
DBuck have?}
\vspace{2em}\par
The control continues with $D_\mathrm{1}$ = $D_\mathrm{2}$ = $D$. The input and output inductances 
have the same value $L_\mathrm{1}$ = $L_\mathrm{2}$ = $L$ = $\SI{0.5}{m\henry}$.

\subtask{Write the formula for the dependence of the input and output inductance ripple $\Delta i_{L1}$ and $\Delta i_{L2}$}

\subtask{To what minimum value can the output power be reduced while still ensuring continuous operation across the entire output voltage range? 
(i.e. continuous current flow in $L_\mathrm{1}$  and L$L_\mathrm{2}$)?}

\subtask{In which section of the output voltage range is this limit reached first on the input side and in which section is it reached first on the output side?}
